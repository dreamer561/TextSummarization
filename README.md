# NLP Data Summarization Project

This project aims to provide a web-based interface for text summarization using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The application is hosted using Flask and utilizes the Hugging Face API for text summarization.

## Overview

Text summarization is the process of condensing a longer piece of text into a shorter version while preserving its key information. This project leverages the power of Hugging Face's transformers, which are pre-trained models for various NLP tasks, including text summarization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd nlp-summarization-flask
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Obtain a Hugging Face API key by signing up on the Hugging Face website.

4. Place your Hugging Face API key in the appropriate configuration file.

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

2. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Enter or paste the text you want to summarize into the provided input area.

4. Click the "Summarize" button to initiate the summarization process.

5. The summarized text will be displayed on the screen once the process is complete.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: A micro web framework for Python used to host the application.
- Hugging Face Transformers: A library providing pre-trained models for various NLP tasks, including text summarization.

## Acknowledgments

This project makes use of the incredible tools and resources provided by the Flask and Hugging Face communities.

## Disclaimer

Please be aware that text summarization is a complex task and the quality of the summaries might vary based on the input text and the pre-trained model used. Always review and refine the generated summaries for accuracy before using them in any critical context.

Feel free to customize, enhance, and contribute to this project as you see fit!
